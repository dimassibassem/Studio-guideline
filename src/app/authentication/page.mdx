# Authentication

Authentication in Bankerise Studio is handled by the Keycloak Identity and Access Management solution.
Bankerise Studio has been integrated into the Bankerise platform as an application.
Like other applications within the platform, it seamlessly incorporates the authentication process,
leveraging Keycloak for streamlined authentication processes.

the application now supports authentication with or without OTP, providing a secure and flexible login experience.

The management of the OTP is done by the backoffice,
the user can enable or disable the OTP in the login process specification of the Bankerise studio application.
