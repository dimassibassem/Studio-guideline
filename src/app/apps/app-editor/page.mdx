# App Editor

The App editor is where you can create and edit apps in Bankerise Studio.

<Row>
    <Col>

        The App editor page displays the app editor. You can see the app name, version, and the date it was
        last modified.

        You can add an icon to the app, theme color, groups access, and users access.

        And the main part is the app definition where you can add models to the app.
