# Modeler

The Flowable Modeler is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool provided by the Flowable BPMN platform. It allows users to visually design and edit BPMN diagrams. The Flowable Modeler offers intuitive creation, modification, and management of these process models.

The Modeler is a web-based application that can be accessed through a web browser. It is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing users to quickly create and edit BPMN diagrams without the need for extensive technical knowledge.

## BPMN elements {{ anchor: true }}

The Modeler provides a wide range of BPMN elements that you can use to create your BPMN diagrams. These elements represent different types of tasks, gateways, events, and other components that are used in BPMN diagrams.

You can drag and drop these elements onto the canvas to create your BPMN diagrams. You can also connect these elements using sequence flows to define the flow of the process.

These are some of the BPMN elements that you can use in the Modeler:
