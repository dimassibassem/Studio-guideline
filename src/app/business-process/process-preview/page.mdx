# Process preview
## Introduction

After clicking on a process from the Processes list page, you will be taken to the Process preview page.

<Row>
    <Col>
        <ImagePreview
            src="/images/processes/process-preview.png" alt="Process preview"/>
    </Col>
    <Col>

        The Process preview page displays the process in more detail. You can see the process name, version, key and the
        date it was last modified.

        You can also see the process diagram, which shows the steps involved in the process.
        You can also see the tasks variables when hovering over a task.

        You can use the buttons at the top of the page to edit the process, view the process history, or delete the
        process.
