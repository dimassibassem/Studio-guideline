# Processes list

## Introduction

After logging in, you will be taken to the Processes list page. Here you can see all the processes that have been created.

<Row>
    <Col>

        The Processes list page displays all the processes that have been created. You can see the process name,
        version, and the date it was last modified.

        You can use the search bar to search for a specific process. You can also filter the processes alphabetically,
        by the date they were last modified or by oldest first.

        Clicking on a process will take you to the Process preview page, where you can see the process in more detail.
