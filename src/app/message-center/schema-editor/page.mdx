# Schema Editor

The Schema editor is where you can define the schema for a message type in Bankerise Studio.

<Row>
    <Col>

        The schema editor enables you to define and customize the schema for a specific message type. You can add
        fields, specify their types, and configure validation rules to ensure data accuracy.

        At the top of the page, you'll see the message type you're currently working on, providing clear context for
        your edits.

        Use the schema editor to structure the fields of your message type, such as defining the `name` and `type` of
        each field, ensuring a well-organized and consistent schema.

        Click the `Properties` button to open a dropdown menu where you can view and add new properties to the schema.

        Besides each field, you'll find a dropdown menu that allows you to select the field type, such as `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Object` etc.

        You can also add validation rules to each field, `min`, `max`, `pattern`, etc.

        If you're advanced, you can make changes directly to the JSON schema by clicking the `JSON` button.
