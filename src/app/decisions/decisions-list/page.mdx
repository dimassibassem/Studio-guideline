# Decision tables list

In Bankerise Studio, you can create and manage decision tables. Decision tables are used to define rules that can be used in decisions and cases.


<Row>
    <Col>

        The Decisions list page displays all the decisions that have been created. You can see the decision name,
        version, and the date it was last modified.

        You can use the search bar to search for a specific decision. You can also filter the decisions alphabetically,
        by the date they were last modified or by oldest first.

        Clicking on a decision will take you to the Decisions preview page, where you can see the decision in more
        detail.
