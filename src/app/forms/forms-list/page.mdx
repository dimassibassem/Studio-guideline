# Forms list

Here you can see all the forms that have been created.

<Row>
    <Col>

        The Forms list page displays all the forms that have been created. You can see the form name,
        version, and the date it was last modified.

        You can use the search bar to search for a specific form. You can also filter the forms alphabetically,
        by the date they were last modified or by oldest first.

        Clicking on a form will take you to the form preview page, where you can see a preview of the form.
