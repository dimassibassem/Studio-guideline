# Authorization

Bankerise Studio supports the authorization process as any other application in the Bankerise platform.

The application now uses the Bankerise platform’s authorization process
to ensure that users have the correct permissions to access and manage the modeler.

While the user is logged in, the application checks the user’s permissions to access the modeler and its features.
If the user does not have the required permissions, the application will display this message.
